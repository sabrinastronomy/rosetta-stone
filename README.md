The Jupyter notebook takes a while to load in GitHub. We recommend you clone the repository and open it on your own computer. The only dependencies needed are **Matplotlib**, **SciPy**, **Numpy**, and **cblind**. We don't anticipate version specification to be an issue, but let us know if it is for you by raising an issue in this repo. The six fields you can explore are below and labeled according to their file name in the Data folder.
