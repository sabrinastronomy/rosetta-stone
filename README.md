The Jupyter notebook takes a while to load in GitHub. We recommend you clone the repository and open it on your own computer. The only dependencies needed are **Matplotlib**, **SciPy**, **Numpy**, and **cblind**. We don't anticipate version specification to be an issue, but let us know if it is for you by raising an issue in this repo.
